# Netflix-Dataset-Dashboard

Tasks To Be Performed:
● Create a new column (Rating*Votes) in Power Query Editor: ‘imdb_score’ x
‘imdb_votes’.
● Create a new column runtime_hrs using DAX. For this column convert runtime
minute values to hours (runtime_hrs).
● Now proceed towards building the report, create slicers for runtime_hrs, release_year
and type.
○ runtime_hrs: Style should be “Between”
○ release_year: Style should be “Tiles”
○ type: Style should be “Dropdown”
● Create a donut chart for the number of movies released in each year and a pie chart
for the number of shows released in each year. Both these charts should be filtered for
movies/shows released after 2010.
● Depict using an appropriate chart, how average of ‘Rating*votes’ vary with runtime.
● How many movies were released in each age_certification bucket since 2000? Create
a bar chart for the same.
● How does ‘Rating*votes’ vary with age_certification? On the same graph, depicts
how age_certification varies with the average runtime_hrs.
● Create a card for First title and a multi row card for description.
